## Run Instructions
To run this application, run `flutter run` in the `cybersheet` directory. When prompted input '2' to select building flutter for web/chrome.

## How to Use Cybersheet
There are two options on how to use Cybersheet, you can create a character from scratch by following `New Edgerunner` or, if you already have a .json file of a character (like `Sample Edgerunner.json`) then you can select `Edit Edgerunner` to go straight to the play/edit view for characters.

### New Edgerunner
Follow through the various options for creating a character, not selecting options (leaving them blank) will randomly select options for you. Note: this randomization does not apply to the Friends and Enemies sections of the lifepath.

### Edit Edgerunner
This view allows you to edit the components of your character in a visual view. The pages are organized under tabs and are as follows from left to right:
[ Overview, Skills, Equipment, Cyberware, Lifepath, Notes ]

In order to save your character for future use, you must select `Save Edgerunner` in the top right hand corner of the page to download your character file.

#### Overview Page
The Overview page allows players to get a glimpse of their characters stats, health, equipped weapons, and other key components. Stats can be edited as text fields, and can be rolled by selecting the button with the name of the stat. Weapons can be rolled by selecting the keyboard icon in the specific weapon to be rolled. Health and Humanity are altered based on stats they are derived from.
